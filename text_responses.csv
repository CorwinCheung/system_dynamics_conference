2022,"['I think the program was good. I think sometimes the presentations where a bit poor in terms of actual presentation skills. Like - longer than the time allowed, or slides full of text / presenters reading the slides.'
 ""The diversity topic was a great idea! Though there was no time to see all of the session, but I'm glad that the recordings will be available until the end of September. I think the selection of speakers was excellent, and the gender balance was good.""
 'The usual parts were in place and worked pretty well. Virtual access worked well enough for what it was. Most (not all) of the session Chairs were careful to check online for questions and that was good. Perhaps it is worth commenting on the unusual aspects.\nRanders’ talk was very good and good to have. He is always good value and seeing the new developments in his thinking was valuable. The Fireside Chat was good to have too.\nThe ‘What can we learn from that?’ plenary just felt strange. There was a league table of commemoration that was really unpleasant to see. It started off fine with John Ansah’s video but then ran into trouble when Bob Eberlein spent much longer on his person. It looked as though the SDS thought that person was more important than the others and that was uncomfortable to be part of. \nFor once the conference theme did seem to come through in the contents – a good thing. We had a wide range of new people and that was stimulating and useful. I liked that aspect a lot.\nHowever, in terms of paper quality the results were mixed. \nJohn Voyer produced an excellent, grounded explanation of the policy sources of structural racism. I did not agree with his proposed policy solution but his paper absolutely established to any doubters the idea that structural racism exists by providing an empirical example. \nAnother good paper came from Erin Stringfellow and Lindsey Pawlowski who showed how different groups experience ‘worlds’ of different active causal links and loops. Really interesting, thought-provoking work. \nThen we get to Plenary 106 and the middle talk. For a scientific conference this was a disgrace. I urge you to look again at the opening slides, in which the speaker offered a series of subjective, taken-for-granted ethical assertions. I would not call this ethical posturing, partly because the grounds are historically accurate and partly because I believe that she was personally sincere. Whilst we all do work that relates to our values this not appropriate, this was a subjective ethical display that was simply not right for a piece of scientific work. In the same style, we saw unsupported assertion after unsupported assertion, some of which bordered on the offensive (“Of course as white people we have colluded in structural racism”). In the same talk there was an inability to define ‘structural racism’ and in the Q&A the speakers failed to define ‘micro-aggression’ in a coherent and robust way. This was poor work. Declaring commitment to diversity is not sufficient. I would suggest that one of the best friends that diversity has is the scientific method and I attend ISDC to see it put into practice. This did not happen in this case. \nI do not know if I got this right but access to the posters seemed to be just to the files themselves. I was expecting the author to be there during the timetabled slots. \nThe WIP worked well as a format.\n'
 'Consider reducing quantity in favour of quality'
 'Some content was hard to follow. I would like to see more models and methodology.'
 'We had very good and diverse content at this conference, and I hope that in the future we will include papers with more transparency, not just in terms of submitting a document on the documentation of the simulation model, but rather the analytical approach behind developing the model.'
 'I feel the program was too intense - often from 8 in the morning to 8 in the evening with many many parallel sessions. As a result I will have much to catch up on online'
 'I would have liked to see more novel and rigorous work highlighted'
 'Content feedback session: the two feedback sessions seemed to be different. I wondered if it is possibly to provide a template for the two-pager to submit for the feedback session (as there exists a template for the work in progress session).'
 'People talking in the equity-related papers could be better informed about race issues.'
 'The conference programme was diverse and interesting. The plenary sessions I attended were exciting.'
 'Some of the sessions were too “woke” for me.'
 'The program is crafted in such a way that is useful to all participants.'
 'because of the time difference I was not able to attend as many sessions as I would have liked'
 'Great content! Some plenaries could showcase better (more rigorous or impactful) work'
 'Limited quality of the work'
 'Parallel sessions that I attended were very good. Some plenaries were not so good: We should be seeing GOOD SD works and not selecting the talks based on the coolness of the topic rather than the quality of the work.'
 ""Good range of contemporary content covering both qualitative and quantitative methods in SD. Creative and flexible interpretation of the 'Diversity Theme'.""
 'Quality was very good compared to recent efforts.'
 'it seems that presenters are very uneducated about topics that are not SD even when they talking about these topics (in particular AI, ML, other simulation methods). The topics are generally the same things that have already been discussed 10 years ago and the SD research seems to be significantly behind compared to other simulation conferences topics using Agent Based or Discrete-Events in conjunction with ML, AI or other modern methods'
 'It seemed to me that assignment of presentations to sessions, especially the virtual posters, were a bit off this year. I am guessing because of the conference being hybrid, there have been more limitations on which presentations/posters can go together in a session.'
 ""I was surprised that there wasn't more made of the 50th anniversary of the Limits to Growth. This is getting a lot of coverage elsewhere, especially through the Club of Rome. I think this was a bit of a lost opportunity and to me highlights a bit of a disconnect between the soceity and the power of System Dynamics to help people understand and address the very major issues that the world is facing... :-(""
 'In my opinion perhaps the most interesting ISDC programme - very diverse topics and speakers. I very much enjoyed that more young and female speakers had the chance to present in plenaries covering also a wide geographical spectrum.'
 'The interesting sessions are often parallel. Therefore, the opportunity to watch recorded sessions is a great plus!'
 'I think that with a little less content the program would benefit. For example: the WIP parallel sessions had 6 presentations, this was challenging for the presenters but also for the audience.'
 'some terrific presentations including even in the WIP sessions. But as usual some plenaries that should not have been plenary.'
 'I am not a traditionnal member as I am at the same time a client and a modeler. I build models to be implemented solving my own problems and as I very rarely see the report of an implementation (one only in this last conference about solving a racial conflict) I do not see any interest gererally in the SD conferences that are 100 per cent research oriented. \n'
 'Some of the workshops were maybe not sufficiently developed.'
 'The conference appeared to be very focused on student projects and upcoming or ongoing student work, whereas for more experienced modelers practicing in the field - there was not a wide variety of presentations on methodological advancements or novel or new applications of SD in the field. Some of the work presented appeared to be very repetitive in application. Perhaps new workshops should also be introduced - as many of the workshops were repetitions of previous years.'
 'Some sessions ended-up mixing seemingly unrelated content. I remember one in environmental sustainability and health. Strechy.'
 'Some of the plenaries were excellent! But some of the plenaries were not very good. The plenaries should showcase the best work in the field, so more work to do to improve this aspect of the conference. One suggestion is to invite authors of recent published work to present in the plenaries.'
 'The people attending are nice, knowledgeable in their field of expertise, but I would have hoped more presentations related to the business world, and more specifically to the topic of organizational development.'
 'It was very good to see people in person this year! Additionally, I really enjoyed every session I attended. Some of the early morning sessions, and the lack of planned breaks between sessions, led to some scheduling errors to accumulate though.'
 ""I could not participate because of the time difference, because recordings were not available. Doing the conference online in this way just doesn't work for me.""
 'I was only able to attend one session so far, so I am not a good judge of the conference. The program topics looked very good.'
 'The conference was of a high standard. Volunteers were able to assist us online. This was amazing!'
 'Provides avenue to improve self and work'
 'Many excellent plenary talks and also good paper presentatons'
 'I saw a scattering of parallels, but all of the plenaries. The content was very useful and interesting.'
 'I still find it a pity that the workshops are so separate from the conference, with fewer attending as a result'
 'I always find it tricky to access the conference website once I purchased a ticket. For some reason it is not straight forward.'
 'Schedule a bit too ""packed"". A bit more time between sessions is needed.'
 'Content of the conference was great. However I found it difficult to access the schedules prior.'
 'The overall quality of the conference was great, though in-person presentations that incorporated both people in the room with zoom presenters/recording were annoying.'
 'Academic focus. Although this was expected, a little more practical applications of SD outside of academia would have been nice (especially for students orienting on their future career).']","[""Overall, the site is functional. However, there are substantial annoyances, especially if you're virtual. The login timeout is rather aggressive, and login can be cumbersome (top menu glitches and captcha). (I'm running on Firefox for better privacy control; perhaps Chrome would be better.)""
 'It would be great to have access to slides/papers from the plenary sessions.'
 'The comments from the 3 reviewers on work-in-progress were very helpful, especially for me a first time SDS attendee.'
 'I imagine that there will be a gradual improvement in fluency with handling online sound and projection as the system evolves.'
 'I personally find it difficult to navigate'
 'In the conference program (website) I never had access to the room number and that was a common for many people. Maybe as a suggestion for next time (due to the quantity of session) have a extra big printed (or projected) whole schedule close to the reception.'
 'I do not know if I got this right but access to the posters seemed to be just to the files themselves. I was expecting the author to be there during the timetabled slots.'
 'System feels a bit outdated but works. Schedule could be made more accessible using filters en search options. Main schedule screen should include presentation titles for ech session (just like the printable schedule)'
 'It should be required to actually upload content'
 'Overall positive experience; however, the presenter slides could be very hard to see. Additionally, the speed of some sessions and the sense of urgency for the presenters made it challenging to get an accurate transcription. I appreciate the recordings for each session. I did regret that some presenters chose not to upload materials. This did make it challenging for me at times as a virtual participant to follow the content. A searchability feature would be an excellent upgrade (key words, presenters, etc.)'
 'Website kept logging me out, plus it was very difficult to find sessions to attend. I missed one completely given by a friend of mine because there was no way of scanning through all the sessions.'
 'some issues at the round table. Loop was mostly empty although Christine was always there.'
 'It was easy to navigate the conference website.'
 'For my online presentation - all instructions were clear and easy.'
 ""I think it was reasonable but some improvements would've made navigation to the different time slots more convenient. there was some confusion regarding the poster sessions at least for those of us online it was not clear how one was to attend those.""
 'Overall positive. Had difficulty creating a customized schedule (not sure if it was possible/available). Some links/ website structure did not easily gave access to zoom links.'
 'Did not use it'
 'Rich hybrid format. There was a realistic intensity in the overall ‘online conference experience’, both intellectual and social, through the highly accessible combination of plenaries, posters, parallels, WIPs and occasional chats in The Loop.'
 'I could not access presented papers, and still can\'t. That\'s terrible. I could not find a list of participants at the conference in person, or a list of people who authored papers. I often couldn\'t figure out how to get to the Conference without going through ""Register"". ""Web Portal"" is a meaningless piece computer jargon.'
 'the website was a bit uncofortable for me to use.. but it was ok at the end... an app would be better to have to organize myself better'
 'I have yet to go back an vie recorded sessions, but I am confident this will be accessible.'
 ""I'm having a hard time finding the recorded sessions from the conference.""
 'It should be easier to access the conference webpage from systemdynamics.org'
 'Website is sometimes a bit slow'
 'It was difficult to navigate in the cellphone.'
 'Ever since we did away with the idea of ""publishing proceedings"", there has been a general decline in conference work being available. The incentives are such that there really is little to no benefit to sharing an actual paper at the conference, which raises a question about what the purpose of submitting a full paper is to the conference might be beyond providing something. Note that many conferences only consider/review abstracts for this type of situation, and those that do require full papers actually have an edited published proceedings.'
 'Access to work is so nice! It is remarkable that we can actually access everything (that participants allow us to access).\nThe website has all the information, but sometimes it is a loooot of information.'
 'Once I found the conference website (with the schedule and the zoom links), it was great. But it took me forever the first time to find the conference website! The main SDS website is simply not user friendly. Too much is stacked in one LONG page after another. We need to redesign the website.'
 'I did not use much the conference website'
 'We may have the schedule of the week in-print form nex time. Altough the online is much more positive for waste avoiding, in-print schedules are still more functional in my opinion.'
 'Occasional difficulty with formatting on small screens, but overall very good'
 'ould no'
 'I was not able to track what was shown in the tentative schedule with what the actual events were. I had marked a number of things I wanted to attend on the tentative schedule, but when the programs went live, I could not find most of the speakers I was looking for. Why was there such a difference in the titles/speakers on the tentative schedule and what was shown on the web site as available? Probably I am missing something but this really hampered my ability to participate. \n\nFor the one zoom session I attended the technology worked well.'
 'Not incredibly intuitive to access articles in relation to the schedule - I think this would be a useful improvement. I had several authors send me their work directly through RG instead...'
 'I managed to access my presentation on the day and other presentations.'
 'Did not get much feedback from my presentation'
 ""It's a very difficult website to navigate...""
 'It would have been helpful to have an app where I could quickly view the sessions. It was not very easy to log into the conference site and read descriptions about the sessions.'
 'Could not find the old fashioned searchable full schedule of speakers (I finally got the link after the conference ended; it was on the society website, not the conference website)'
 'It was easy to find things and also to access recordings.'
 'Some recordings were (not) uploaded (very late) so I had to go and keep checking which was more annoying than knowing it takes, e.g., 6 hours.'
 'There were too many pages and too much distracting text to find programs and in particular workshops quickly with few clicks.'
 'The conference website could be easier to navigate with a more detailed menu at the top of the page.'
 'The conference website is hard to search and has a series of cascading windows that is not user-friendly. The layout was horrible.'
 'Unfortunately I am not happy with the conference website. When I open the page it seems that I logged out but when I try to login, I lose the page showing the conference schedule so I need to find and open that page again but sometimes I never can go back to the schedule etc. Also, I was expecting to see my video but only audio is available.']","[""Everyone tried their best while providing technical support however due to the hybrid nature of the conference sometimes it was hard for online attendants. The main two reasons are the lack of moving camera and adequate voice from in person presenters. For next conferences it would be batter to have the speaking person in the video frame. There were fixed cameras in the rooms that's why we were not able to see the person asking something from the audience. Some presenters were far from the microphone or naturally moving or walking while presenting. This resulted in difficulties for the online people. Also, sometimes we only heard humming and squeaking noises as the microphones in some of the rooms under were not muted during preparation. Since the speakers did not speak into the microphone, hearing their voices along with other voices made it difficult to understand.""
 'Very impressed by how smooth it was. It would be great to also see the audience in the room for those joining online to enhance the experience of being there.'
 'sound in some rooms was bad. Graphical quality of the laptop in the plenaries was terrible. It should have been replaced or connected correctly. Many sheets were not readable for online participants.'
 'Chat with SDS helped me with a few problems at the beginning.'
 'See above'
 'I think the whole organizing team did an amazing job! It was a very positive experience!'
 'Lots of people trying hard to make things run. Appreciated.'
 'Some session chairs could have used some more guidance and assistance'
 'Volunteers were awesome!'
 '\nThe volumteer arrived 10 minutes late for the session I was chairing because she was covering two rooms. I had no idea how to transfer the presentations to the computers, which was extremely frustrating; I wish I had received more specific instructions on practicalities. For example, how to use the computers on-site. Or how to ask for help if I got stuck, because when I went down to ask for help from the registry desk no one was there either.'
 'pretty good'
 'Amazing and excellent. Sara and Billy were on the top of providing the technical support. Conference Chairs, Birgit and Nici were in contact to helo the speakers; and the Chair sessions made contact ahead of time. Thank you for the daily reminders of my sessions.'
 'In all the sessions I attended or viewed, only one presenter had serious technical issues. I had none for my virtual presentation.'
 'I did not have queries - as all instructions were clear.'
 'I think everyone did a great job'
 'Experienced technical difficulties (loud outside noise during presentation), zoom link with audio or video problems, inability to mute, etc.'
 'As an online participant I experienced mostly quick responses to my chat questions about technical glitches. Always friendly.'
 'When I asked, I got help.'
 'i got some trouble in my presentation and there was no help available'
 ""The reliance on the online scheduling didn't work for me. I know that you could save separate sessions of interest and that it would appear as a personalised schedule, but I was accessing this from my phone and it was just not easy to read or access. I didn't want to be walking around with my laptop open findng my way between sessions. Also, the saving of sessions only applies to the sessions, I was variously interested in papers WITHIN sessions and often needed to transfer between sessions. This was impossible to navigate easily with the onlune schedule. I ended up referring to a PDF of the schedule on my phone and highlighted relevant intersting parts to me.""
 'Some session chairs were a bit lost concerning technical settings'
 'Occasional problems with setup as chair'
 'This was a massive achievement. Well done, everyone.'
 'hybrid is hard - the team did an outstanding job!!!'
 'Home office staff and volunteers were incredibly responsive to any issues that arose.'
 'For the record, I volunteered. So I saw the proactive attituted of people to solve the issues. But have not seem much of it from a participant persepective.'
 'Front desk all week long was a very nice idea : always someone to help you out. Assistants in each room was good too for presenters.'
 'When I asked questions, I was answered in a reasonable time, but, for example, recordings were not available.'
 'I received some good technical support on accessing the live conference page through the chat/email service.'
 'As always with technical support, a bit of room for improvement but most issues were handled quite easily. Still waiting for a verification of bank account so I can pay my invoice through my organisation.'
 'Staff were readily available to assist!' 'Excellent'
 'everyone was eager to help; though not always super fast (time zone differences)'
 'The technical support staff were exceptional.'
 'had a lot of tech issues, mics being on in the room, not hearing, not seeing... and often the tech person online had no access to the ground person...that was not as good as last year.'
 'The system on-site a bit too advanced such that the Human was out of the loop. Hence, we had to rely on a lot of volunteers to do even simple tasks. But their help was phenomenal.'
 'Received technical support though delayed for few hours.'
 'The staff and volunteers did an incredible job working towards a successfully run conference.'
 'technical support was quite good. Volunteers and staffs were everywhere. But the food was not satisfactory.']","['Not being there physically made it difficult to get feedback, meet and talk from experienced people who are successful in their field. Maybe more focus should be pay on this issue for next conferences to be improved. It was as if the people physically there and the online people were split into two. And it was difficult for online people to have productive conversations in this separation.'
 'I think virtual participants are inherently disadvantaged. Would be nice to improve on this dimension.'
 ""Didn't really see an opportunity to socialise when attending online rather than through zoom chats, which are only available if you are part of the session there and then - or reaching out to people via LinkedIn.""
 'I wuld appreciate an innovative solution for socializing with other online participants and online with in-person participants.'
 'The opportunity to socialize was weak for online participants, as is so often the case. There were some interesting side conversations going on in the zoom chat, which was helpful. The Loop, although a valiant effort, did not work well for me. Maybe try something more like online speed dating?'
 ""Neutral. I have had helpful responses to questions I've sent to presenters.""
 'Almost inevitable for Virtual. The Loop needs development in one of two directions: shut it down or extend it. All the times I went there I found no one. So stop wasting resources on it. Or, arrange for every session to have a pre-announced Loop session. But do not continue with the current approach'
 'Nice people everywhere'
 'As an international virtual participant I found this very challenging.'
 'All the social events was designed perfectly.'
 ""There was a problem with the catering (will detail more later) which didn't help for socializing, and also due to the very intense program there was maybe less time to socialize""
 'Possibly, there could be a specific networking moment that facilitates networking in groups, besides the banquet which was extremely nice. Also name cards and tags facilitated networking.'
 'Not possible remotely. The last Bergen conference did a great job at this.'
 'Although I attended hybrid, I had an opportunity to network and make new connections.'
 'Virtual participation made socializing difficult'
 'I being online I did not meet many people. Hopefully, at the next conference, I shall attend in-person and can socialize.'
 'attending the remotely still has its faults and one of them is there is no real way to ""socialize"". I\'m not sure what the solution to this is, but I think the intention was to use the ""loop"" for this purpose and people could meet there and then go into a chat room. But the loop ended up being used for other things so this was not possible. In any case using the loop for that purpose is certainly not the same as meeting people by happenstance which is always fun at the SD meeting – meeting new people that you didn\'t actually know in advance. Not sure what the solution is for that. But it\'s worth a try.'
 'Virtual participation made it socializing difficult, especially with time change US - Frankfurt.'
 'Due to the time zone and the virtual experience, I could not socialize with anyone'
 'Very few breaks. Great program overall.'
 'Breaks between sessions are needed.'
 'It is difficult to socialize in the online mode. One can do it, but it needs an extra effort, while the person-to-person mode it is easier, because it occurs naturally.'
 'It may seem surprising that an online participant could find and enjoy opportunities to socialize. I liked the fact that I could see friends and colleagues live in the auditorium. I met new people in The Loop - just a few, but we had interesting conversations.'
 ""Breaks were good chances to talk. Barbecue was great. But you should kill the loud music -- we're there to talk and listen to each other, not music.""
 'in particular during the banquet, the socializing opportunities were abundant'
 'I believe the the totally virtual setting provided us with a better chance to network online, but I had the feeling that virtual attendees were a bit left out this time around. As a result, I will do my best to attend in person, whenever I can.'
 'As always this was gret in person. I did wonder if this would have been difficult for those attending online, which I am likely to do next year. As this is a mjor reason that I come to the conference, I am not sure how useful this would be online? Especially if you want to chat to people who are there in person?'
 'More organized social events would be helpful to meet others'
 'Always trade off between presentations and socializing. Dont start at 8:30 am after banquet.'
 'This is difficult online.'
 'The nature of virtual attendance makes it nearly impossible to socialise'
 'It seems there was no easy opportunity to engage with online participants, except during the questions after presentations.'
 ""I gave a neutral rating because I didn't go into the Loop so I cannot evaluate it. I feel that I am not yet ready for international travel to conferences (I've been quite cautious throughout covid). Running a hybrid event like this so smoothly is a massive achievement. I hope to attend in person again, but perhaps not transatlantically (I am in UK). I had hoped to attend both Bergen (!!) and Frankfurt travelling by train. But if nobody were to travel intercontinentally (to save the planet) our community would lose something. We need to achieve an environmentally responsible compromise, as I am sure the Society leaders are aware.""
 'stickers in name tags helped a lot to connect'
 'great for in person folks. unclear to me about online folks.'
 'I would suggest socializing spaces where more senior practitioners interact with new members of the society.'
 'more designed moments to socialize would have been great'
 'There are too many presentations that leave no time to socialize; And I am no more interested to socialize with SD members, using SD in very different circumstances.'
 'I was not able to socialize!'
 'Obviously limited when attending virtually'
 'Attending virtually made socializing difficult, but not impossible. The discussion session format helped make the virtual attendees feel part of the team.'
 ""People are nice, you gotta be proactive and talk to people. \nThe 'flags' to be placed on the nametag really play a role.\nI wonder if a speedmeeting kind of activity would make sense.""
 'It would have been nice to have a few more breaks throughout each day in order to catch up with other attendees. I ended up missing some sessions just so I could connect with other people attending the conference in person.'
 'Sadly I could not attend 100% of the events, so my overall assessment is positive but I am not in a position to give a comprehensive opinion on this item.'
 'I could not socialize.'
 'If I had attended more there were good opportunities to network virtually.'
 'One of the best I have been to in this regard, lots of planned empty space which made it easy to get together with former colleagues and friends in the field. Barbeque was a great evening.'
 'Met new people online/hybrid.' 'OK'
 'Maybe helpful with more casual opportunities for juniors/students to socialize with more senior researchers of the same research topics/background. It can be difficult and scary to connect. But maybe this is more useful at the student conference.'
 'I did not attempt to socialize vitually (which is why I will attend in person next year)'
 ""In the virtual world, there was little opportunity to network/socialize. Part of that may have been the time difference, but from the various activities, I didn't see either the in-person attendees or the virtual attendees interacting online (note I wouldn't have expected the in-person attendees to spend much, if any, time online).""
 'In absence of the echo sessions there was no online gathering so no socialisation either'
 'Hard to network and socialise via online format.'
 ""It's tough being online. I hope to be there in person next year.""
 'Wish there were more opportunities to socialize. The banquet was really great and I wish we had more opportunities like this!']","['I was very impressed with how the hybrid format worked.'
 'I also like the size of this conference.'
 'My only disconcert here, is that the lunch boxes were poor in terms of nutrition. Please keep in mind for next time that the brains of all participants are working at full high speed during the whole and diverse content of the program. I suggest, for the next conference to have a more varied and rich-nutritive array of food for lunch with more plant based options.'
 'Too expensive for what you get in return.'
 'I wish I could get better and more constructive feedback on my work; my session was relatively empty, and the feedback from conference reviewers was limited to «your work is good.»'
 'It is simply extremely expensive (e.g. compared to Operations Research conference EUR02022, which was in much more expensive Finland, had two nice dinners and regular lunches...). Conference is great but deadly for my budget.'
 'It was very interesting and some things worked very well (e.g. quality hybrid meeting, good rooms and venue), but other were poorly organised I had the feeling (catering...)'
 'I think for the next time to improve more in the lunch because always the same sandwiches where not very good'
 'If we are going to use the hybrid model, scheduling should be cognizant of multiple time zones and the number of participants from there. Schedule for USA was pretty awkward.'
 'Diversity. Dynamics. Dialogues. Well done to the conference organisers.'
 'A fantastic conference as usual.'
 'Conference is great. Price, compared to other similar conferences, is too high.'
 'The registration cost is too high, the most expensive by far from the ones I attend.'
 'Good value for money.' 'I found the scientific quality a bit low.'
 'The first hybrid conference -- a tough task (or tasks) to pull off. Kudos to everyone who made it happen.'
 'I\'m not sure if I would go again, because it\'s waaaay too academic... there were no companies presenting real cases (or at least i didn\'t find any), mostly were students working on small models for ages (yes in a company but as researchers/students, not as employees or leaders)... this conference made me feel the struggle that comes with using SD in a company for real significant purposes, which is in a way very insightful... I didn\'t see any KPIs directly ""we improved something by X%""... the results in general seem to be extremely vague or incomplete... compared to other conferences in which results are clear.'
 'This year exceeded my expectations (which were relatively low given my experience with virtual conferences). The IT situation went quite well, and the mixed in person and virtual participation was better than any other virtual conference I have attended.'
 'The program was very full and it were very long days. I think the energy of the crowd would benefit if the program starts a little bit later and ends a little bit earlier.'
 'registration fees are too high compared to other conferences of similar size and with similar mix of constituents.'
 'I should have used the 1, but I do not want to appear as totally negative.'
 ""I don't think the hybrid format wasn't really all that effective. Perhaps effective in boosting numbers, but in a number of cases, folks were disappointed that others weren't attending in person, i.e., they we expecting presenters to be present and interacting.""
 'I really enjoyed the week.'
 'It is a very nice community. People are nice and chill.\nThe venue was fantastic. Million thanks to the Frankfurt School!'
 'There are very new ideas were presented and discussed! Enriching the mind with knowledge and a great opportunity to communicate with colleagues - one of the main values of the conference!'
 'The conference price seems too high compared with other similar-sized academic conferences.'
 'It is interesting. But I suppose one has to accept that only a small fraction of all the posters and presentations may be of interest for future applications. A clear University/Reaseach representation, which could be in my view more balanced with representants of the business world.'
 'It was not valuable for me. I wanted to participate but could not.'
 'Aside from my above challenges, the whole virtual/hybrid/in person endeavor was impressive. I hope next year I will either attend in person or be able to understand better how to find the sessions that interest me. Because of the time difference I will be watching sessions virtually. It would be nice if you could extend the time they are available longer than September 30.'
 'Very informative and standard was very high.' 'Excellent'
 'I would have loved better options for lunch. Possibly hot options are more variety. It would have been nice to even have the option to visit the cafeteria on site at the school.'
 'I think the hybrid approach worked quite well'
 'The content was great and Q&A after each session went well. Again, there was virtually no networking online.'
 ""I am glad I could attend from afar but the experience wasn't as great this year""
 'Loved the sessions on LTG!'
 'The hybrid format is really horrible both for those who attend online and those who attend in person when an online presenter is incorporated into the mix. .']","[""I tried to go to the online poster session echo version, and almost all of the breakout sessions were empty, no presenter/author present. Perhaps you'll need to make it clearer to those presenters that they are supposed to be there for both runnings of the poster session. Or give presenters the option of which session they want to go to according to what time zone they are in, and not try to have all posters in both sessions.""
 'I would have preferred more consistent access to supporting materials and slides.'
 ""WIP format is a good way to create more opportunities for people to present their work and for attendees to know they are entering a session with unfinished work. However, allot of work was too premature even for a WIP presentation. 5 minutes is to short. Cut the number of WIP presentations and increase time per presentation.\n\nModel Expo format didn't work. It was basically another WIP session with partly mediocre quality. I would expect a deep dive in to a well developed and researched model.""
 'Plenary too long. Some parallel should be wip'
 'For the workshops, it would be helpful to know who it is intended for: limited knowledge with sd, advanced, or everyone.'
 'Feedback session: the two feedback sessions seemed to be a bit different (one using directly feedback from participants and the other not). I wondered if it is possibly to provide a template/requirements for the two-pager to submit for the feedback session (as there exists a template for the work in progress session).'
 'I attended hybrid, though I missed being in person. However, it was great experience.'
 'Thanks.'
 'in general I think the sessions were very good. As usual there were quite variable due to varying quality of the papers in parallel sessions and poster sessions.'
 'Competing priorities at home and office kept me from participating as much as I would have liked.'
 'I encountered technical access problems on Day 1, the Student Organized Colloquium. Unable to join the poster session and the plenary panel. Frustrating - hence my neutral numerical evaluation of 4. I imagine the content was good. Session formats in general are good. I particularly like WIP sessions for their quick-fire talks.'
 'As a workshop facilitator, we planned for an only in-person format. We had mentioned it in our workshop deacription. Therefore, we were not prepared for online audience.'
 'the workshops i attended were not interactive'
 'It was hard to ask your question in plenaries.'
 'Really enjoyed the workshops and hands-on work.'
 'There were too many parallel sessions at the same time and it was difficult to choose; also made assistance to be scarce in some sessions. One hybrid workshop was not designed for hybrid configuration and online participants were not involved as expected. Time to change between sessions was too short and did not have any space for delays.'
 'Too many parallel sessions on simultaneously - very low attendance in some sessions.'
 'You might need to rush from session to session to get it all and discuss in the meantime.'
 'It may be consider the possibility to have more than 4 slides for participants of WIP sessions'
 'I think we should ask two senior members of our community to provide guidance each year to the students organizing the colloquium. They do not take over organization of the colloquium at all. Instead, they can help the student organizers identify and reach out to angel advisors and panel members who have genuine expertise in the field. There was high variance in the quality of the angel advisors and panel members for the colloquium this year.'
 'The feedback session I attended (as an observer and commenter alone) was less interactive than I thought it would be. The conversation turned out good, but I think some more explanation of the format and expectations of that session would be nice.'
 'I could not participate due to the time difference between Frankfurt and Buenos Aires.'
 ""Please exclude my rating for the online workshops on July 12. I didn't join. I rated it only because the form required it to do so.""
 'Parallel sessions sometimes suffered from technical difficulties i.e. people not having muted microphones or jumping into the sessions and talking over people in the room. Virtual posters were hard to attend and could have used some dedicated screens to allow for easier reading than on laptop screen. Poster session needed more room to allow for mingling and a bit of covid respect distance as desired.'
 'Very impressed.'
 ""The hybrid version failed in my view. The online audience was mostly forgotten, so we watched people write on whiteboards without seeing the white boards, having a lot of background sounds....and there was no real online facilitation. After 2+ years in the online world now I had higher expectations but I guess everybody was so happy to be able to see people again that this fell off. And I get it but the experience just wasn't as great.""
 'Easy to access and attend.'
 ""The sessions are great and I really enjoy the breaks in between for coffee. It would be nice to keep online people together and the in-person people presenting together so there's less mixing. Seemed like there were a number of technical difficulties.""
 'in-presence poster session was good but I did not understand why whole aisle was not used. There was a huge aisle but the posters and people were stuck in a small space. After a while it became impossible to join a conversation. It was also not nice in terms of the covid issues.']","['The best contributions were very good.'
 'Occasionally the posters have too much text and details.'
 'In particular the WIP format was very short (nothing to do about) therefore the quality of the images of the CLDs was very limited making difficult the presentation and message to audience process. I also think that many Parallel contect could have been WIP content, and vice versa.'
 'Very mixed. See long comment.'
 ""Quality of WIP and model Expo was to low. \n\nAbout 20% of the parallel presentations were below standard. Poor explanation of objective, method and results. \n\nMany parallel presenters, also does presenting well researched topics, could benefits from the 'less is more' advice. Less slides, less graphs, less unreadable diagrams.\n\nI found the posters to be of high quality. Some would have made for very nice presentations. \n\n""
 'Even though some work was probably really good, the presentation was hard to follow so you do not get as clear as an idea.'
 'More feedback sessions to be included'
 ""it's hard to give an overall rating of the presented work given that is highly variable in quality.""
 'I really would like to be able to see papers.'
 'i think 50% of the presenters lacked the knowledge on their own topics'
 'The overall quality of the parallels were higher than usual. The plenary sessions were rather hit or miss.'
 'i liked the diversity of presented work'
 'some really great sessions, but still too many poor quality sessions. Important, especially for plenaries, to have the program committee review slides and presentations in advance to improve them, from what fonts to use (larger!) to content. takes time but worth it.'
 'wide variance on the quality'
 'These works are not convincing for somebody who has some knowledge of SD : everything is mediocre, the pre qualitative study, the models (rares embedded tests like Vensim reality checks), no deep analysis and never any implementation. And not convincing for a client, as there are no references of people having the experience of having used SD practically.'
 'The work was interesting, but the levels of application should perhaps range from beginner, intermediate to more advanced applications.'
 'Some WIP were very much initial and did not present enough info to get valuable feedback. Some only using text, no tentative representation or model...'
 'It may be consider the possibility to have more than 4 slides for participants of WIP sessions'
 ""The work presented is well-thought, it's more the practical applications that should be emphasized""
 'Everything felt much more polished and of higher quality than I remember from prior conferences. To be clear, prior conferences were good, but this year felt especially polished. Maybe it is due to people holding back over the last two years, but that is pure speculation.'
 ""I don't know, I could not participate in any way due to the time zone difference, and the recordings were not available until 48 hs later.""
 'Plenaries are good but quality of work presented in some parallels is embarrassing'
 'The one session I saw was very good, and well presented.'
 'Quite mixed I found that some of the WIP sessions were more scientifically complete than parallells. i.e. methodological clarity was lacking in some of the parallel sessions in a surprising fashion. I think that opening up the submission to extended abstracts instead of full papers would be of benefit to drawing in more quality submissions as well as those working on the fringes of the field in order to grow the community.'
 'Great work indeed.'

 'Overall, the conference was fabulous. Thanks to everyone who made it happen. A few suggestions for improvement are as follows:\n\nAt times I was not able to hear the offline speakers clearly (I was attending online) due to background noise from the audience. Dedicated mic for speakers and audience (for questions) may be required.\n\nLoop was a great concept and well supported by staff. But I feel that some alternate method may be needed to make online networking more effective. Discussion board was used last time but without much success. And 3D environment was used the year before, again with limited success. What I will be interested is to view people in the virtual lobby (with their names, may be like dots or similar) with possibility to chat one-on-one or in small groups (like what happens in offline format). I think that will provide better opportunity for online networking.\n\nTexts of some of the plenary presentations were not readable.\n\nMusic during waiting period was very nice. But it was bit loud at times. So even though Sara was trying to communicate some message, it could not be heard clearly due to the music.\n\nSome of the improvement adopted in one parallel session with respect to audibility was not adopted in other sessions (with different session chairs). There is a need for improved communication between session chairs so that all are on the same page with respect to any new approach adopted as the conference proceeds.'
 'More talk about models, and more experienced people showing their models to students. This would be so valuable for learning and developing skills.\nHave organizations with job opportunities present for students without work experience who just graduate to keep them involved in the field and not have them to set up shop somewhere else.'
 'This question may disrupt your insights: ""If you attended a conference before, which formats did you experience? *"" I answered No to the previous question having never attended a conference before but was forced to answer the above in order to move on.'
 'I have a couple of suggestions please free to dismiss them if not relevant.\n\n1. To request presenters for parallel sessions submit their slides prior to the session like WIP and combine them the transitions between slides would be smoother. I dont know if we do this now already or not but it took them until very last minute to submit their slides. Maybe more strict follow up.\n\n2. If we are using the hybrid model, we ask the zoom host to share the slides to avoid technical difficulties with hardware, or we brief the chairs on how to do it prior to the conference. The current briefing session for chairs is focused on navigating the conference website rather than on-site logistics.\n\n3. To ask presenters to include a slide with the method they used to build their models. \n\n4. To allot more time between sessions for preparation.\n\n5. Wishful thinking suggestion: we could potentially invite two or three subject matter experts who are less familiar with the topic of system dynamics to attend a thread such as health, energy, etc during the conference. and have a panel discussion on one of the last plenaries so they can reflect on what it was presented. As it can be expensive we can each year have only one topic?!'
 ""Discussion - very often there wasn't enough time. So many questions remained unanswered.""
 'The catering was very disappointing, with just a small bad quality sandwich for an entire day. I was very hungry. Also there was not enough vegan bags, and the sandwiches consisted of a slice of cucumber and tomato with bread for five days in a row (!!). Additionally I was shocked at the number of plastic bottles used during this conference. I personally think that System Dynamics conferences should pride themselves in being environmentally friendly, with plant-based and plastic free catering for instance.'

 'Website improvement and better sponsor promotion.'
 'To improve more in the food'
 ""On the Monday SOC, online presentation was given one break room for each person. The problem is if you stay in your room, you would lose the chance to listen to others. If you move to other's room for other presentations, there would be no one in your room and no chance to share your project with others. But even you always stay in your own break room, you have to repeat the presentation again and again to every round of listeners to the room. I think there is a beautiful design to give every person equal chance to present their projects but it turns to be difficult to follow in practice.""
 ""Thanks to all organizers for this great event. The main issue I observed this year was with the PhD colloquium. While there were some interesting aspects, the overall quality had much room for improvement. Attending this event for almost a decade now, I believe that the student organizers don't have the right coach(es) or enough engagement with them to be guided in setting up this event. Three main issues. First, the panel discussion included people who would not have been the best choice to motivate students. The society has a wealth of good speakers, but other than only one person on the panel, the rest were not helpful. Also, some of the discussions were more relevant to the group of experienced modelers rather than those who had just learned about the field for a week. It seemed to me that the main criterion to select them was diversity, which is essential but not a sufficient factor. Second, the round table discussion session could have been more productive. Several years ago, the experienced modelers were sitting at a fixed table, and others were rotating around the room every 10-5 minutes. That allowed students to chat with several exp modelers. This year, they were stuck with only one person, and I did hear from students that conversation got a bit weird at one table, and they were waiting for the session to be over. Third, in the past, many students had a chance to present their work for a few mins and receive direct feedback from exp people in the room--some exp modelers were already prepared for sharing feedback. This year there were only a few student presentations, but those were selected/best projects without a clear feedback-sharing setup. This isn't helpful mainly because students may not pay close attention when the presenter talks about an application far from their interest--and the Q/A after the presentation often focuses on the application than the SD side. The direct feedback on every presentation from exp modelers in the past made it educational for everyone in the room, regardless of the application area. Overall, while the quality of the main conference has been on the rise, my observation is the opposite for the student colloquium. And this should be of the highest priority if we aim to attract more students to become new members of the SD society.""
 'The first hybrid conference was great.'
 'Lets maintain the current format for another year'
 'Continue to expand reach to new students. Engage as many students as possible in all aspects of the conference.'
 'In case the number of volunteers is restricted due to the policy that they get a refund, maybe a solution could be to ask volunteers if they want to apply for refund, and once the budget for refunds is used up say on the registration website that no longer refund is possible. I am just suggesting because I heard that some volunteer worked much more that 25-30% of the time and refund is not necessary for all.'
 'Restore breaks between sessions'
 'Please improve legibility of slides in the Audimax'
 ""No specific suggestions. It's clear to me that much effort has gone into creating this year's hybrid format which I think is very effective. Keep going in the current direction of travel!""
 'Lower registration fees'
 ""bring companies with real projects, bring government institutions with real projects not generated only by students.\nAlso increase the number of hybrid simulation models, more on other methods, seems that the community needs it and there's a lot of lack of knowledge on this I think""
 'Make the schedue available in print. Encourage people to use online for sure - I want to save paper too - but allow the option.'
 'While there is an Oceania conference, I feel the rotation of the ISDC would be beneficial if it had a 3 year rotation between Europe, the US, and southern hemisphere.'
 ""As long as the conference is offered with a virtual option I will really struggle to convince my employers and funders to allow me to go in person (why would they pay thousands for me to attend in person when I could attend for a few hundred online?). Would be nice if perhaps it alternated years (in-person only one year and hybrid the next) or was made so that during the in-person year, all presentations were in person, but people could attend virtually to watch. Virtual participation does little to build networks and community. Select plenary presentations (the good ones) should be made available to the public on the society's website or youtube channel. That would allow people to see what the conference is about and would act as a promotion tool.""
 'In one of the breaks we discussed the idea of having parallel conferences in Europe and the US. All the in-person attendants highly valued to meet people in person, at the same the acknowledge the need to reduce flights to a minimum. Having parallel (or sequenced) conferences with hybrid settings every other or third year could be a promising approach.'
 'keep hybrid format'
 'it would be great if more senior experts participate and engage. Also, an advanced track for summer school would be good. More topics which touch data science. Method feedback: This survey misses an overall satisfaction question at the end: ""All things considered how satisfied are you with...."".'
 'chairs need better instructions on how to handle the technology. sessions should strictly finish on time'
 'conferences should only be held in major gateway cities, alternating between NA and Europe. Conferences in other regions should be off-cycle, not instead of the major conference. The data re clear (see work by Rogelio Oliva) that conferences in ""remote"" locations (not a major gateway city like Frankfurt, Boston, Chicago, London) the society suffers in terms of participation, revenue, new members, and quality of participants and presentations.'
 'Plan for more time between sessions.'
 'Much less presentations of much higher quality!'
 'My answer to the following two questions is maybe/it depends because of the price to attend in-person is getting prohibitive, limited in-person options for attendance (from what I understand is going to be the new model), problems with the feedback sessions, and ultimately, mixed value proposition for actually attending. I will probably continue to attend just to stay connected, but I feel much more ambivalent about recommending attendance these for someone new to the field than I did 5 years ago. So given that, my answer is ""no"" to recommending the event to others, but ""yes"" I\'ll probably continue attending.'
 'The student colloquium was engaging though it is not necessary to have two round table/world cafe sessions - perhaps one world cafe session in the morning and then a small SD case study (group exercise) in the afternoon session.'
 'Perhaps the schedule could be more smartphone friendly.'
 'If possible to send a first tentative program earlier - this will help making the decision to attend or not, especially when the conference is held across the ocean :-)'
 'Please continue to allow remote participation even with live sessions. At minimum, it allowed me to multi-task a bit when I suddenly had to attend to another matter that overlapped with a session. But some of the better questions I received in the session I ran were from the folks online!'
 'I will be vary wary of participating in virtual conferences in different time zones. I think that I will participate only in face to face events whenever possible.'
 'Make the orientation to the conference available as a recording. If you already did this, I was not able to find it.'
 'None' 'Remain as opened as you are'
 'I would suggest improving the lunch options.'
 'Maintain and improve the support for hybrid attendance'
 ""I don't know the solution to improving networking online. I know several things have been tried, but it's not there yet.""
 ""sharing resources/ approaches of how modelling can be done in different settings - especially now online and remote and highlight ways to evaluate effectiveness. I did like the 'schools of thought' presented by Timothy Clancy and maybe there is a way to structure / highlight conference presentations by such a structure. I always find it funny that we structure the conference by topics (e.g. public health, ecology) rather then functions (community based modelling, swaying leadership with models, etc...) as so much is transferable and if I would be interested to learn about a topic (eg public health), I go to a topic specific conference. But that is just me :). I did like that the online participation was relatively cheap, so managing expectations around what is possible online would be good in the advertising .""
 'Europe feels more central location for hosting the conference, especially for the community in India and other Asia. In future, more conferences could be planned in Europe or even in Asia.'
 'Offer a 4- or 8-page schematic summary of the conference program as a pdf that can be printed.'
 'The hybrid format is not the best one but could be anyhow a good option going forward'
 'No more hybrid. More time for socializing and better website to search sessions.'
 'Hybrid did bring advantages in terms of people being able to attend the conference. However, presentations (both plenary and parallel sessions) via zoom were sometimes']"
