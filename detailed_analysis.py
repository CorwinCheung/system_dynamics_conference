# We will organize this more detailed analysis into 4 parts

# First, we will use dimensionality reduction and text clustering
# techniques to find pockets of attendees who had similar
# survey responses.

# Second we will carry out sentiment analysis on the text responses to
# see the general tone from each question.

# For text data, we must do this: Sentiment Analysis: Use a sentiment analysis model to
# determine the sentiment of each response. There are several pre-trained models available
# , like the one in the TextBlob library or the VADER model in the nltk library.

# Identify Positive and Negative Responses: Based on the sentiment scores, classify the
# responses into positive, negative, and neutral categories.

# Keyword Extraction: Extract keywords from the positive and negative responses using the
# TF-IDF vectorizer or any other keyword extraction technique.

# Identify Top 5 Things Liked and Disliked: The most frequent keywords in the positive
# responses will give an indication of the things that attendees liked and want to see
# more of, while the most frequent keywords in the negative responses will give an
# indication of the things that attendees disliked and want to change.
